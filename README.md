# Minor-Projects
Minor Projects made by Sarvagya Kumar during his B.E (Bachelors in Engineering) journey are present in this repo.
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis made by Sarvagya Kumar for his Ist Semester, Experiential Learning Project in the course Programming Language Course - Fundamentals of Python (22PL15A).
This E.D.A uses various python libraries such as NUMPY , PANDAS , MATPLOTLIB and SEABORN to extract usefull data from a csv file called neo.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects) and present the findings in the report.
Since this is a project made in First Semester it might not be of Industry Standards, but I will continue to upskill myself and soon I will be able to make a Industry standard project.
